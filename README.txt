Inspired by the iPhone's autocorrect feature which changes "drupal" to "frypan".
Conceived at the Toronto Drupal 7 Release party.
Made possible by the crazy new hook_page_alter().

Thanks to the DugTO team.

Known issues:

 - doesn't update the node title.
 - pretty much has no practical use.
 - can break page markup and cause some things to not work (like node edit).
